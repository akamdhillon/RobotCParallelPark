This project was completed in December 2021.
In a group of 4 including myself, Kevin Kim, Sarah Elisabeth Cleghorn and Vedant Grover we designed, programmed, and presented a parallel parking simulation.
Using Lego Mindstorms Ev3, we programmed a robot to simulate parallel parking using RobotC.
Three scenarios were presented:
  1. Parking between two objects.
  2. Parking behind one object.
  3. An obstacle in the parking spot
    In which the robot will detect the object and decide not to park.
